These scripts produce histograms to show the HEEP cutflow for a given sample in three
scenarios:
 - HEEP 4.1
 - HEEP 5.0 (50 ns startup)
 - HEEP 5.1 (25 ns main running)
 
 The scripts are run in two steps:
 1) python HEEP_cutflow.py
    This produces a file called histograms.root .  This script does most of the work.
 2) python combine_histograms.py
    This combines the histograms to produce a single plot.

The input ROOT files should be in a directory called "ntuples", and look like:
  outfile_X.root where X=ZprimeToEE_M5000 etc
You can change the name of the sample name by changing the variable sname at the start of
the HEEP_cutflow.py script.

The script expects a directory called "plots", where it stores the output.
